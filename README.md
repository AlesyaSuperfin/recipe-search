I created Recipe Search application to learn how to work with Props, useState(), useEffect and API.

* The project is based on React.
* The project successfully used a fetch request to the API (edamam.com/).
* You can write any ingredients and find a lot of recipes form database of 2 villione recipes from edamam.com/.
* Simple and nice design!
